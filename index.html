Speaker 1  0:00  
Can you hear me? Yes, you're still cutting out a little bit though. Can you hear me? Okay, or is it rivers me

Speaker 2  0:09  
must be, must be our microphone. Let me call to me. Come back here a little closer. I

Speaker 2  0:23  
some that happens not want to get things done, person who is about to ring the alarm bell for her third election.

Speaker 1  0:36  
All, David, you cut at the beginning. That was cut out again. I'm sorry. Go ahead and that sounded it sounded interesting. So if you don't mind repeating

Speaker 3  0:46  
yourself, let me turn off my camera. See, it saves the violet. Yeah, okay.

Unknown Speaker  0:53  
What you've just witnessed or witnessed yesterday, blue guys around I've seen quite a bit,

Speaker 2  1:02  
which is done immediately. Can you hear he looks like you're, you can't. No, still not

Unknown Speaker  1:11  
Bob. Can you hear

Speaker 4  1:16  
Bob Horn? You're, yeah, you're, you're cutting out when the pictures were on, you were moving in like a robot. So I definitely were having a problem with your connection there.

Speaker 1  1:33  
Maybe you can, maybe you just, can you call your call in with your phone and speaker it or something.

Speaker 5  1:40  
But I mean, when pages move to your office, I have feeling it's the access point we're going to move to my office. Okay, okay.

Speaker 4  1:56  
Hey lady, how are you and I'm My name is Steven, but they call me Bob, so we will. I'm just working with them on this waste to energy project.

Speaker 1  2:09  
So where is where? Nice to meet you. Where are you located?

Speaker 4  2:13  
I'm in Barbados as well. Okay, I just have a different location today. Got it? I Marie is waiting to be admitted. Marie is another member of the team. Here you are.

Speaker 6  2:37  
Good afternoon, everybody. Good morning. I listen your kids morning.

Speaker 4  2:51  
I think Lee David was saying that we were at a meeting, actually, when he was asked to set this meeting up. So that's why all of us are here at this point in time, interested in hearing what your project is all about. All right.

Unknown Speaker  3:16  
These are any better. Can you now hear

Unknown Speaker  3:19  
me? I can hear you now. Yes,

Speaker 2  3:22  
great. Thank you. So, as I was saying this, this is not an unusual activity for our prime minister. She is very bright, very dynamic. She's won two elections where she's won every member of seat in the parliament, 30 to zero, twice about to ring the election bell again for her third election, probably her last. She's getting criticism for having done a lot of announced a lot of things, and a lot of things haven't gotten done. So she's getting very sensitive about getting projects done quickly. And as old engineers, we know that things that get done quickly sometimes. And as Brian Haynes, I think, who's also on this call, recognizes you know you want to move quickly, but you want to move accurately and not waste a lot of people's time. So I have on this call Bob warmer, who worked with Barbados light and power for 30 plus years, who's a very senior member of the staff there, and is probably the person most responsible for the renewable energy development that we've had in the Hyland. He was the instigator and writer of the renewable energy writer, which allowed the first renewable energy systems to come on stream. He is a consultant to us. Barry O'Brien, who's one of the founders, is Barry on this call. I don't see it. Barry O'Brien, who is a very seasoned CEO in the telecoms industry, ran Barbados in Jamaica for Digicel, and has been with Williams, Caribbean capital, as one of the founders since 2018 He's based in Ireland, although he spends a lot of time in Barbados. He's an electrical engineer by training, but he is a deal maker by nature. So he's, he's, he's, he's on, on this call as well. So just to give a little bit of background to Barry and Steve, who are very major players in Williams, Caribbean capital, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Energy and a few other people, yesterday, had a meeting with Lee Jestings from exanor, which was a Nashville, Tennessee based company that has come up with a very clever system to basically for distributed energy systems, using using waste, organic Waste plastics, where there is a combustion and then that combustion stream is cleaned and fed straight through a turbine. So it's a breaking cycle, as opposed to a ranking cycle, where you raise steam in between. You know, they've got three or four systems operating and a lot of excitement and money and US government behind them, the Navy, the army are looking for these systems again, because they're small, they're distributed. They're 225, kilowatts, and they they burn a variety of waste streams, which all those services have. The military has in the United States been a bit of a leader in renewable energy. They've tried to set up, you know, mobile renewable energy systems so they don't have to rely on long gasoline logistics lines and things like that. So that's sort of where we are. There is a meeting now on Thursday with the Prime Minister, where she wants to know, and part of this is being promulgated because of the of the budget, what we call

Speaker 7  7:34  
it yesterday, the estimates, is coming and so On. Is it possible the event that we can record, record this, this meet, so we can take, just for, for us to take accurate notes.

Speaker 4  7:54  
Okay, I see a fireflies note taker. Brian, yeah,

Speaker 7  8:00  
and you could kick that one out, because that follows me around. I don't usually. I don't think I am. I'm subscribed ever,

Unknown Speaker  8:10  
yeah, I started recording. Thanks. Okay, so

Speaker 2  8:19  
we have been requested as two week a term, but requested to meet, I think it's three o'clock on Thursday, with the Prime Minister and other people present to give her an update of where we stand, The concerns she has, or the concerns, I think, reflected in the meetings we have with Brian Haynes and his team about the cost and some uncertainty as to whether or not there was additional cost beyond our 48 cents per kilowatt hour, and that Lee is you is Barbados, so it's 24 cents less, about seven or eight cents, which go to just providing the revenues for processing and and and dealing with All the other non organic, non combustible waste. So it's really about 17 or 18 cents, us a kilowatt hour.

Speaker 1  9:28  
So you have so your, your deal is, you get paid by kilowatt but you're really effectively not charging a tipping fee,

Unknown Speaker  9:36  
right? Yeah. I mean, it's a

Speaker 2  9:40  
combined, it's, it's about 48 cents. There's a capacity charge and an energy charges. There isn't all base load plants, but on the surface, it's roughly 48 cents a kilowatt.

Speaker 1  9:50  
And that's the 20 that's the 25 megawatt plan that

Speaker 2  9:54  
you're Yeah, yeah. And then biomass, and biomass, and also, this is something that, you know, Brian had suggested the utility come in. This is something utility really likes, because they're looking for base load right energy. There'd be retiring a number of low speed, medium speed diesels and one low diesel in the next three to five years. So they need this in their expansion plan is built in this 25 megawatts of base load renewable energy, or biomass. So there's a lot of a lot of players in this project. Has been around since 1996 so that's in reference to her, you know, we're using old technology. The technology has changed quite a bit. You know, it's like saying an airplane's old technology. You know, it keeps getting upgraded. So So does this doesn't have the flexibility of what you're proposing, or, in some sense, the simplicity. So I think that there is potentially some potential for moving moving forward in some way. As I said, our major concern is the proven commercial status of the of the technology, and it may well be by the time we're ready for it, you've got 100 plants out there been operating for multiple years. So I think it's some thing we need to be conscious of and keeping keeping the forefront of our minds. But I don't think it's in my view anyway, and Bob may have a different viewpoint as a old utility and but it's not sufficient just to say no at this point, because there are distributed energy opportunities out there in the short term, actually, with hotels. I mean, this system is in a 40 foot shipping container. Basically generates 225, kilowatts, net, after, after the, you know, energy required to to operate the plant, they can be set in place and put in place fairly quickly, a couple of days, call it a week, and then it can be moved so and they can operate behind the meter, where the rate you could get possibly would be much higher than what you can sell it to the utility. For utility would not be happy about that, as I mentioned to Lee earlier, but just anyway, so we can we, what we need to do this meeting is start to exchange information and get a better understanding of what what we're doing. And we will send to you, Lee, couple summaries that are fairly general of the of the project, which talk about all the benefits that the Prime Minister, when we approached it with this, was very excited about the agriculture, employment, saving of foreign exchange, all those elements that The Green Energy Park brings together where they have expressed some concern is the cost. As you know, heard the minister Cummins say on a number of occasions, they're very, very concerned about, you know, the impact on the consumer. And what we keep saying is that the impact on a consumer, from a macro economic point of view, may actually be less because you're you're you have, you have a cleaner environment, you you don't have waste problems. You don't have the problem of creating new landfills, of dealing with waste. And you know, waste dealing here is a problem, because, like many places in the world, you put it out on the street and you never think about it again. But yet, you know, we're a small island. We're one of the most top 10 densely populated countries in the world. So there are very few places to put it, to be honest. So some form of conversion of waste to energy. To me, it's always made a lot of sense in all these small islands.

Unknown Speaker  14:28  
Jad, so can I fire some questions at you?

Speaker 2  14:33  
Yeah, I just want to just just Barry and Bob, are there any big things that I've missed? So before we start to get into the detail that you that you need to understand, that Lee can answer perhaps,

Speaker 6  14:46  
I mean, Lane, I mean, you're not, you're not pitching this basically as a solution for a 30 megawatt or 25 megawatt biomass, wave to energy plant. I mean, this seems like a far smaller scale that could maybe integrate into SPRC. Is that more where he expresses Lynn,

Speaker 1  15:07  
is that is that question to me? Sorry? Lee, yeah. Oh, yeah. Let me, you know, let me, let me. Me ask some questions before I my first mind is, we're looking at 10 to 11 megawatts. Let me, let me just ask some questions. So essentially, the way you have it set up, you have whatever you might call it, some form of a PPA with with the utility at the accents, and the financing to build the plant. Is that coming privately, through you guys, or through the government,

Speaker 2  15:41  
it will come. It'll be mostly private. Okay? The Inter American Development Bank is very, very keen to get involved. They'll bring in the IFC and the there's also some Middle Eastern money. The Prime Minister has mentioned a couple of times mastar. We've talked to them. They seem to be interested OPEC, as opposed to OPIC, that she minister talked about, has some money that they want to spend. So the Prime Minister is is not concerned, nor should she be about about financing it, and we are, we are confident that we can finance it, but it'll be we. What we don't have is Williams does not have the capital to be the majority's shareholder, nor do we have the ability to provide the performance wrap, the guarantee that this systems are going to work. So you've been talking to some big operators, yeah. So you're,

Speaker 1  16:46  
you know, basically classic sort of developed product project developer, right? And then, of the 25 megawatts, how much feed stock do you need for the 25 megawatts, and how much is coming from the island, and how much you don't have?

Speaker 2  17:06  
All the solid waste will be here, tires, you know, all anything that is organic. We believe that for the biomass section, we probably have 20 to 30% now, just in terms of the cleaning of rat land, the there's a number of places where invasive species have gotten quite serious, and so we're looking at the National Conservation Commission, you know, cleaning those areas up. In order to finance this, we will need a guaranteed fuel contract. So the first four or five years, we will import pellets or wood chips. And we're looking mostly at South America, although Guyana, I've been down there on a trip with the Prime Minister, and looked at the opportunity. There's a lot of saw mills there, and they don't really do much with it. And so there's potential of getting it out of Guyana, which the Prime Minister is happy about our contract with the Fair Trading Commission. The price rate requires us, within seven years to have 70% of the material for the biomass plant grown locally. So that would be king. Grass is the lead agent right now and again. This would be put in old sugar cane fields, which have been abandoned. And you know, we've got quite a bit of interest from the Agriculture Society, because they think they'll get paid better by us than by the government, who currently is the is the entity paying for for the sugar that they raise. And so we believe we will have 100% of the fuel available on the island, but it's going to take a while to prove the plant and then for the planters to to buy into the program fully and start planting in grass. But from what naturally exists, or what comes across our way bridge, or what you know, we know we can go out, we're probably about 30%

Speaker 1  19:20  
okay, so I'm framing those because I think, I think was Barry asked the question that, you know, we look at things as, what waste that we can what kind of waste, how much can we get, and then how much value energy and carbon we pull off that, right, versus if you need 25 megawatts of base load power for other reasons, and you don't have enough fuel, then you're going to import it from another island. So I'm trying to hone in on, like, what's the known from a distributed standpoint? So if we had, if it's, let's say, like I said on the call, you got 1000 1200 tons a day. Let's assume 20, let's say 250 tons a day is, is organic plastics that we could use. That would be about 50 systems that would be about 10 to 11 megawatts of electricity, plus, you know, 50% more of that thermal just, just put that in perspective, so there could be a phased approach right where, you know, there's a 10 megawatt target in phases. That includes a behind the meter strategy as well as a centralized strategy your recycling center. Does it use much? Is it pretty laborious? Or does it use much power?

Speaker 2  20:34  
Most of the most of the power it uses is machinery. So you

Speaker 1  20:41  
know what the base load power, the average base load power for that,

Speaker 2  20:46  
I don't off the top my head. I mean, we have a we have some big grinders. We have one that's fixed, that uses its wire to the mains. That's like an 800 horsepower motor. So when that kicks in, you know, the demand charge goes way up. But most of the stuff we used are is mobile and has, you know, small diesel, diesel engines on board so that, so the shredders and the and the trommels, all that sort of stuff is mostly fossil fuel, okay? And then also trucks and tractors are running on diesel.

Speaker 1  21:21  
So I'm gonna, I'm just gonna talk through sort of how I'm gonna ignore a central waste energy plan for now. I'm just gonna talk through the way we would look at it, what we're doing other islands. So we would be looking for, okay, where can we get the waste turned to fuel? First thing we look for, where? And we very much focused on private versus government, right? So if it's to government, we jumped another location. So we look for a who controls the recycling centers, right as you okay? So yes, let's now. We're going to, what's the economic how much waste we have recycling center? What do we need to do to doesn't have to be pellet pelletizing is only if we have to move it somewhere. You don't have to really have to really be pelletized. It's just a, there's a there's a cost benefit of that, right? And then, for sure, we want to run that facility on on its own ways. We want to have it where we're using its own biomass. We end this to run that facility. So let's say that's 500 to 750 kilowatts. I'm not sure what kind of equipment you have. It's going to get more obvious. Get more obviously, as you go to 25 megawatt feed stock, then we then, where would we put the system? Where would we drop? Where would we take this 250 tons? Where does it the systems go? The best place would be where energy is the most valuable, right? So that would be behind the meter and where there's thermal use. So are there any thermal behind the meter opportunities there? Well, there's going to be resorts, and we look at process and some of the process facilities might need 10 units, by the way, if it's big. So we'd be looking at, you know, the thermal and power behind the meter scenario. Each one of those changes the price. So if you think about, we call it an extra multiple. Looks like, if you look at the donut hole of X dollars, a ton of value. We create some of its power savings, thermal carbon credits and waste diversion. You have a market where the waste diversion, from an economic standpoint, is zero, right? And they're not paying you to take the waste, but your energy is really high. So the combination that just has to work for everybody, the best for us, obviously, like we're doing Singapore, everything is expensive. With that you can't be you know. So that's sort of the economics. So we would look at launching in an island going, Okay, let's find a recycling partner, and let's ultimately want to go to, we want at least 25 system. We're going to, let's say, 50. What we can do because the waste. So where's the start? Who's the partner? Where's the starting point? Let's get one or two, and we won't send, like I said in the call, we're not going to send one system anywhere. We have to be there for at least 15 years. So we got to have enough to justify our maintenance team to be there, right? And so that's how we'd be looking at it. We would look at you can get 250 tons, you would now continue to expand on your equipment package. Was the economics trade for us. And you to do that. We would then, you know, take that agreement, that there would be agreement with the government maybe, or we would go behind the meter with private industry. So that's the balance in Punta. Cana puts a con. It's all private, but the developer owns the utility. So it's a little bit of a fake deal, because it's a separate entity, but and then, and then, you know, we when they knew we could grow with it. Now, on the carbon credit side, we would then try to sell those forward to offset the capex. If that was possible. From the US side, the XM thing would definitely potentially reduce some financing. Could reduce financing costs, especially if it's wrapped around something else, because, you know, there's a lot of favorable stuff now being American manufactured at least the next couple years. So that's how we'd be looking at it. We would get all those economics and say, Hey, customer, we're going to save you X dollars a year and with no capital, right? That's how we'd be looking at so if you look at so if you look at it from the government standpoint, you know, where are they the middle person and all these things. And by the way, what I didn't mention is we really don't focus on residential, you know. So you're getting a lot of your waste is residential. It's harder to clean up, quite frankly, than others. So there's a match there. We might not. We don't want to take all the waste that you're taking so you're making money, I hope, on what waste you take that you can't convert to another value step somehow you got to make, get paid for that. So that's how we look at so I don't know how now you've got a project. I don't know if it's if it's you've permitted, it's purchased, if it's still on the books, but that's how we would approach the project. Yeah.

Speaker 2  26:14  
So a couple of things pop up there. One we understand very well the benefit of doing things behind the meter, in terms of the direct benefit for that entity. We are a small island utility, 100 megawatts base load, probably 150 megawatts peak. And one of the things the utility worries about a great deal and will impact the rates to the residential consumer, of which I think there's something like 60,000 Bob residential

Unknown Speaker  26:52  
meters, 130,000

Speaker 2  26:55  
130,000 Okay, most of Those would be the middle income or lower income. So all of those people vote. So this Prime Minister is very I see Delano smiling a little bit, but this Prime Minister is very keen on making sure that the costs and burdens are spread equitably, so that if the sandy Lane Hotel, which is our premier foreign exchange earner says, Oh, look, I can, I can generate my electricity cheaper. They pull out of the grid. There goes a good payer, you know, megawatt and a half. And now those costs of the utility are going to be spread over people who don't have the ability to go so when we first started solar, for example, that was the problem is that all the guys you know, you know, who already have a foot in the door, have have, are putting in the PV and the little guy now is going to be paying the costs, because it could be higher than the low Speed diesel costs. So that that strategy, I think, makes a lot of sense. And Punta Cana, I'm not so much sure, from a just a policy point of view, not an economic point of view, but a policy point of view, we would you, you would have to be very careful about looking at ways to mitigate that impact. If you started taking off the big hotels and the big we don't really have any big manufacturing companies, but even, you know, at 225 kilowatts, you would take off most of them, the guys who make the pepper sauce and jellies and whatnot. So that's a, I think, an issue. Secondly, if you are taking the really good organics like that, the hotels do that are fairly clean, and leave SPRC with the balance of you know, as you say, the residential stuff has tin cans in it and broken glass bottles and glass bottles. There is no source separation here to speak up. A few communities try and do it, but the recycling markets are so depressed right now that you know, the cost of getting a container up to sbrc, loading bailed cardboard into it is more than we can sell the container for, because cardboard right now is about $10 a ton, you get $25.25 tons in a 40 foot container. If you do it right, it's 250 bucks, even when it was $100 a ton. You know, our ports very expensive. So that's why

Speaker 1  29:32  
now we want we make, we'll make that energy all day long. That's definitely economics, where the same economics not the same scale. But here it's not worth the recycling cardboard, even in a lot of big cities.

Unknown Speaker  29:46  
Yeah. Brian,

Speaker 7  29:48  
yeah, yeah. So Lee, in the arrangement here in Barbados, we operate primarily with a net billing approach, rather than the net metering that you would be tending towards is a net billing approach, compact to some degree, work with what you are talking about as well. Where, yes, you you have, you produce the power, you sell the power. But then there is a difference in the overall bill that the I it that the internally, overall, built for the for the say, for the hotel, for example, is that framework compatible with your approach, where you were saying in terms of behind the meter approach?

Speaker 1  30:46  
Well, I'm not, I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure. I'll be what the question is. I mean, I think, I think David outlined, it's clear to me that that, you know, if you want to reduce the energy costs to residences. That's the objective, and they already have subsidized waste disposal costs, so it's going to come down to energy reduction. And usually there's always a lot of you always got to add capacity that's very expensive. So putting behind the meter doesn't necessarily reduce the cost like you just described. It might, because you still have to. You can offset, you know, problems of not having enough power. Then, if it comes down to saving energy prices, then, then that means the utility has to buy power cheaper than they do now or produce it. Right? So the only value proposition there, if there's not a waste value proposition, it has to be, if they're, I think that I want to say, and Punta, can I think it takes some obviously, it's varies on price of oil, but think it's, you know, 816, 18 cents, just to make it themselves, right? So, yeah, their operating costs are right there. So you know that, you know if you can sell to them for their operating costs, and then, then they'll all day long, right? If it's cheaper than, who gets to say, and if it's cheaper, who gets the savings, right? Yeah, so, I mean, I think that's

Speaker 2  32:18  
in the maintenance business, and they don't want to be right. That's right, putting chocolates on pillows, right? That's right.

Speaker 1  32:28  
So, so I think that's the gap is, there's, how do you channel what I guess, what I'm hearing that they want is, how does our value proposition challenge money to a residents and not to business,

Speaker 2  32:45  
is really well, I think, I think it can challenge, channel it to business. I don't think that's the challenge. I think the problem is the again, utility and the government, to a certain extent, has had this concern of, you know about equitable we, we try and are generally fairly successful at being an equity driven, equitable driven society without some of the extremes you see it in other economies. And you know, the utility, you know, has has not quite subsidized rates, but the first bit of energy use is a fairly low rate, and then as you go up, it's so it's an inclining block rate, rather than the traditional declining block rate, or for energy. And so again, the big expat houses that have air conditioned 17 rooms, you know, they're going to pay more per unit of power than my house, where I have two fans in a refrigerator. So it's, you know, it's a very different kind of scenario. So we need to be conscious of that. And if the value model is predicated on all behind the meter, which I don't think it is, but I don't know. Then that could be a that could be a challenge.

Speaker 1  34:08  
You know, let me, let me, let me. Let me take an, I'm sorry, let me take another sort of look at it, because I do think there's an energy waste here that people are looking at it from different so give you an example. Take General Motors. They're in around the road from us. They use 200 150 megawatts average load, right? And they have enough weight and waste probably gonna read all these plastics so we can make, let's say, a megawatt off their waste. Well, the guy in Detroit megawatts not worth his effort. He's got a lot of other problems out of 200 it's not strategic, but it's 100% of their waste diverted. But it's very strategic to some people, right? So we look at, we're, generally speaking, we're always solving a waste problem first, and then what makes it economical is the value we get out of that waste you're defining. We got a base load power thing. And I think if you were to take a different spin, I'm not saying to do this, it's a little bit like a Punta Cana. You go in, what if you paid the residences, you put a convenience center, and they got $10 a ton to bring, you know, energy waste that now, do we solve a waste problem? Is it less stuff that goes on the road? Now they make money because they feel good, they're, you know, then, then we take that, you know, we get the $10 a ton because we're making money on right now, the only way to make money, it looks like, is on the power side, and then thermal, if we find other thermal locations, or we've got a bunch by each other. Do we desalinate with that thermal do we? Do we, you know, do we do a second power cycle to get more power? We have extra we have extra inverted capacity to each box? Do we integrate intermittent renewable? You know, there could be an energy center concept of it, but based off of solving the waste problem first. That's sort of how we come in, because we're not as strategic with distributors, not if you need, you know, tons and tons of megawatts in one spot. Our cost per kilowatt, by the way, would be cheaper than any I think I would challenge your biogas. You're doing it, we could still put 30 of ours and probably be cheaper per kilowatt. That's not a that's not our that's not our model.

Speaker 2  36:23  
We are not doing bio gas. We are not doing bio gasses mass burns. Okay, so got it. There's no bio gas. But I would agree, I would agree with so we are trying to solve the waste problem. That's how it came out. And originally it was just a mass burn plant, because we weren't aware of your technology and the other technologies we looked at it, particularly in the pyrolysis and the gasification, we ruled out because they weren't proven. And we, I think we have been proved wouldn't be correct, because all the ones we've looked at, they start up a pilot plant. They want us to come along and be the guinea pigs. And we said, No, we can't do that. So the reason it has grown to this large base load plan is the is the requirement of the government to have a no tipping fee and B, cover the cost of of handling all the waste. As I've said before, that can't be processed. We still have to sort it, pull out the metals that are valuable, right? You know, haul it. Haul it to abandoned quarry, basically. So that's land reclamation, but there's costs associated with that. That's what's caused this thing to go from a seven to eight megawatt project to 25 megawatt project. Is simple economics, right? I need to generate that much electricity at a at a average cost that would allow you to siphon off 25% of it to pay for something that had nothing to do with electricity. This is where the utility is always commented. This is where Brian Haynes has has zeroed in on that immediately that raises the cost that the consumer is seeing. This is where the Prime Minister and the Minister of Energy keeps saying, Well, we have to keep the cost down. Well, first thing to do to keep the cost down is not siphon off 25% of top line revenue to pay for something that has nothing to do with generating electricity. This is the utilities perspective. They're a private company. They're, well run, they're they're the best in the region, in the Caribbean, and so, so it becomes, it becomes complex, because the we said, okay, right, we're going to put in 110 of 200 of years to generate enough electricity to to to provide that. That what the what the utility is going to need as they retire fossil fuel, and what we would need to generate revenue, she's still going to say, you have to pay for SPRC, and you have to bring in a low and you're not going to get a tipping fee, and you have to bring in a low cost. So it's a, it's a, you know, you're, you're solving a, you know, an equation that's got a number of variables in that that is challenging. So what we came up with is is this project? Is it absolutely the best thing going? You know, I don't know you have a potentially disruptive technology that could, that could modify what we do, but the overall concern of no tipping fee and paying for

Speaker 1  39:39  
I got a RC I got needs to be addressed. It makes it makes it I mean, it makes sense. I mean, obviously, you

Unknown Speaker  39:44  
know, in some ways it makes no sense. Well,

Speaker 1  39:47  
I think, I mean, I'm not very calm. I you know, Enexor wouldn't build value proposition that needed to bring in pellets on a boat, boat. I just put that out there. I like to switch grass that were that, whatever you call to hear the scenario. So I would grow, I would grow this from a distributed standpoint. I would grow, I would target on our waste streams that are the biggest problem, that are the easiest for us to use. And I would grow with that. And then I would, when you can switch grass or whatever, we add more, we keep adding. And I would make that. I would line that out. Now, if you need to get bulk base load power for the utility. That's sort of a separate deal, I think, because that might be a 15 day, you know, and you gotta, you gotta get guaranteed off take from the pellets, from, you know, this one's gotta take that risk. I mean, yeah, that that.

Speaker 2  40:34  
But from a utilities point of view, if you had, you know you're looking for 20 megawatts. So you say you had 100 of these machines, some of which would be, for example, an SPRC, because that's where all the waste comes. And some might be distant sites. And they did run 24/7 would that help or hinder the utility from the point of view of establishing base load generation, or would they be indifferent?

Speaker 4  41:11  
Well, to be honest with you, there are a lot of considerations there how it's going to be you mentioned some in terms of the pricing and and who benefits from that waste stream. Ideally, they if it could be distributed, I think it would be useful. But the challenge really is, how do you get the the things to different points the way? So I think doing it in the way that we had proposed. But remember, as you said, the waste stream is only about 25% of the total capacity of the system. To make it worthwhile, we have to with our technology that we're using. We have to have biomass on top of that, and whether that comes locally, ideally, if we can use it locally, but we the cost of doing that is unknown at the moment. So the point really is, how do we transition? And I think how Lee is talking about is that you start off with something small, and then grow it, which is always ideal, because you can see how it goes before you spend all the money, but like, empower would? It would be a totally different model to what we are looking at right now, because they can no longer depend on that level of capacity, because as it grows, we don't know how quickly it will grow, etc. So isn't

Speaker 2  42:48  
it in some ways better? Because rather than flip a switch on, 25 mega co ops on or off, you can do you can, you know, it's a much more

Unknown Speaker  43:00  
manageable. Yeah.

Speaker 1  43:03  
The key is, and I'm not, I'm not, not sure how to what I'm pushing for here. The key would be your off take. Obviously, off take has to match that mean, because if utility is going to take the power, we had a project with Bitcoin were proposed on in Ghana, Africa, Ghana, and you know, they want to locate them at these, you know, their substations they have around the country. I mean, they can't, it's hard to move stuff around. So, you know, you get into that, you know, the recycling center, you know, or transfer station by x, is located by, you know, substation. So the utility wants to take the power because they don't want it behind the meat, you know, get into things like that. But what I would do, and I don't know when's your when's your commitment to do the 25 megawatt ones? When's your schedule for that?

Speaker 2  43:50  
Well, again, we we have a rate, we have a PPA. What we don't have is full regulatory approvals, so we're starting on the EPA and the fuel study, and, you know, so it's ongoing, it's moving forward. And is, you heard the minister say today, you know, the Prime Minister was hoping for two years

Speaker 1  44:10  
ago, right? So, so you're took

Unknown Speaker  44:13  
four years to negotiate, so you're

Speaker 1  44:16  
at least two years out. Then, yes, yeah, absolutely, yeah. So, I mean, I think, I think you go in, I think the scenario would be, we partner together, and we go, you might have a dual strategy, right? Because you're going to go through this, all this financing, design, construction, risk phase, and that phase won't be freaking making money, you know. And so what we would do is, you know, so it might not be, but I think so, how do you get the money back? What's it comes down to, you know, baby, maybe there's a waste energy combination now, maybe it's more visible for somebody to have a program where you reach out the community, and there's a convenience there, they drop their stuff off and they get paid, or they get some kind of drive to retail Coca Cola. You don't ever backs them up like that. That's what we're doing elsewhere, and you get a another feel good to your residents is that they change behaviors and they make a little money, and not just power. Only look at your base load as a separate deal. Maybe there's a combo. Maybe there's a combo of our waste solution that generates some level of energy on a phased approach, and then you're still doing your, you know, working your switch, your pellet deal from Ghana. Maybe it's not 25 megawatts. It's, quite frankly, if you get the right fuel deal, you 25 megawatts, you could probably still do

Speaker 2  45:42  
you Yeah, at that point it doesn't. Again, the biomass component was put there to support the solid waste solution. That's right, and given the constraints on that solid waste solution, that's, that's what, that's what we came up with. You know, if we could have built 15 and generate enough revenue to cover those costs, we would, okay, sort of 20 to

Speaker 1  46:08  
25 Okay, so the 20 to 25 was just basically your economics. Basically the 2025 was your you had to get to that volume. I get you.

Speaker 2  46:17  
Okay, well, that 2025 includes the waste energy. So if you pull the waste energy out, let's say you can take 100% of it then, then you're looking at what else you can generate to cover those costs, and you wouldn't build the green energy part. I mean, you know, this is only a project I've been working on 21 years, and I'd like to see it

Speaker 1  46:42  
go, why I like the day? I like that. I like that concept. Why not? I mean, I'd still so I think what we would do first of all, we have an Enexor Barbados, and we're partners, or whatever we call it, and you have your recycling center, which is your energy Park. You can, you park the units there that when you then you're going to send to the power grid. You put there, you power the units is self sustaining. Two years from now, we can pull CO two off of it. And there's other things that can develop and and we'll find places you're gonna have too much thermal there. We're gonna be losing thermal energy. But that's another plan. Two years we could monetize that thermal energy. Someday you have an advanced you have advanced energy Park. The hotels like that. And you know that you tie with the hotels they you know, the customers like to recycle, and then you make some kind of incentive, or share money on the wayside with the residents as a set of energy side. Yeah.

Speaker 2  47:38  
So the question then becomes the technology you will. You describe where you are in the rollout process so that Barry and Bob, both electrical engineers, can can understand what the risks may or may not be associated. Do you

Speaker 1  47:55  
want, do you want me to pull screen up and sort of show what's in the box again, please?

Speaker 2  47:59  
Okay, I think that would make you want to see that. Barry, Bob, Barry, you still here I

Unknown Speaker  48:08  
am, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1  48:10  
I don't have to be. That would be great. I don't have to. I've seen the slide before, but if you guys want to,

Unknown Speaker  48:15  
yeah, please do. Please do. Okay.

Speaker 4  48:18  
I was gonna ask just that question, because I think that is an important part for, like, empower as well.

Speaker 1  48:26  
Okay, well, let me, let me go ahead and just, I'm gonna hit three slides. Then I don't some of you already heard this a couple times. So, so essentially, the core product we have is the Bio-CHP product, which we've been talking about, which is what I set out to do seven years ago. And my whole philosophy there was, I wanted to divert waste from landfills, new business waste from landfill, and try to get as much value as possible. And we focused on energy, but really we've taken the step of focusing on transforming carbon out of the waste. So as you probably know, organics is 50 plus percent carbon, and plastics are like 80% and it's valuable. So we want to get we want to monetize this. So the first step, we have the Bio-CHP. Then we take that exhaust, we have another product, which is basically in our development right now, being being built. That's the contract. That's the one that doe bought in the army. And then we'll be able to take our exhaust and get high purity CO two, and there's ways to monetize that in the US. I'm not sure how that's applicable to Barbados. And then we have a project we're working on to take the thermal energy and desalinated and distributed basis. So this is sort of where just think about that. My company's built around that, and the other philosophy we've had, we won't develop a product that needs government or incentives to hunt. So we've always wanted to be it's all about economic, financials to us, or else we don't do it. That's what I'm setting that up, because it leads to our technology. We've tested just tons of different waste streams in all different forms, all military types of ways, plastics. Sagar, we're the first ever make powered Sargassum bagasse, every type of plastic except PVCs, and that's what we continue to do now. So it's not uncommon for again, in Punta can, they're sending two tons of palm fronds for us to demonstrate and run, run up tests on that. The key with our technology is, you know, it lets us do things like we can put an additive in a in a in a feed, stop to neutralize a reaction that other technologies can do. So the specs on the one we're talking about is 225, power, 350, thermal, and it's basically three and a half to five tons a day, depending on the energy content of the waste. Obviously, it's plastic, it's it's less fuel that goes in, and they run by customers don't touch it. Generally speaking, it runs by itself. We, you know, we operate it basically one, run 24/7, and then, like I said, it can do waste. We can build this and install this in a day or two. That's gust that's connecting to our power panel. And you'll see we're connect to a hot water loop in our building. And it's designed for hurricanes, designed to be really rugged. But here's where I want to build the technology. It's built around a custom built micro turbine that we developed. We pay for the development. This with bore Warner. Is the turbine is built into sub modules and pieces. And the business model is we assume we swap it out every two years and we put a new turbine in, it takes about an hour to two hours to swap put it in, and it's the only moving part that touches the gas stream. So once we do that, if the energy value is worth more at that time, or waste disposal, the acid actually appreciates the value, which is why we, we want to own the asset as our business model. So that's a key part of it. Will islands go. We would probably swap them out more than two years, just because the harsh climate. And that's just a pricing mechanism, because I know what it costs to rebuild it. So instead of maybe two years, we might go a year and then we would price it. But obviously energy is more valuable into those environments. So that's sort of how it works. And then I'll tell you. I'll show you here real quick. I'll show you. One more slide, one second I had to pull out to get it.

Unknown Speaker  52:35  
One second here I'm

Speaker 1  52:47  
right, here we go. So the way what works inside the box is that we drop the feedstock. Can you see this? Okay, we got we dropped the feedstock in a reactor vessel, and which is under high temperatures, less than 1000 C and it's under pressure. It's a modified Brayton cycle, heavily patented, and it goes the feedstock goes through a very turbulent zone, and it goes through a sort of a torturous path that goes through a cyclonic zone. And what we want is is complete, or as close to 100% combustion as possible at the right temperature, at the right time, and that's what gives us our ideal combustion. Then those gasses have inorganics in them, anything that grows has got a metal or something in it. So we separate those and we filter them out. And then those hot, clean, pressurized gasses that go directly into the turbine that obviously expands, creates work, generates the 225, kilowatts of power, and the waste heat then is lost as pressure and lost temperature. We recover that heat. This is a hot water heat exchanger, which is typical, but it could be for drying, it could be for use, for desal or something like that, and then it's exhausted. So that's generally how it works. That's in a 40 the 225 kilowatt unit is in a 4040, kilowatt, or, excuse me, a 40 foot container, physical container. And then what, we're looking at doing on the islands. This will give you an example. This is Dominican Republic. We're starting in Punta Cana, and our partnership is, you know, basically they own, they develop the whole area. It's very independent of the country. They have their own power plant and recycled plant. They own the airport, very, very large, lot, way more resorts, I'm sure, than Barbados. So think of that like a hub and spoke approach. And then when you go to other areas, you just have different waste streams. You have more industrial waste streams than you would like in a perhaps in a hotel area, but they also have tons of plant waste. Now, what they did their government did their say have the same issue with you all have, if you charge money, they they don't use the landfill. So the government created a law where, if you're a qualified recycling facility, you get $25 a ton from the government across your meter. So that's how they and then, by the way, a lot of the big companies, they still want to do

Speaker 2  55:26  
the right thing. Sorry, where's that 20? Where's that $25? Come from Lee,

Unknown Speaker  55:30  
the government. They tap, they they tax everybody.

Speaker 2  55:33  
The tax. That tax is the subsidy of, subsidy of, that's right,

Speaker 1  55:39  
there's a business tax. I don't know what it's called. So think about their taxing. They're taxing Dr businesses, right? And then they're moving that money, in essence, free, I'm sure. And they're giving the recycling center.

Speaker 2  55:51  
Is that? Is that? Is that tax correlated to the amount of waste they use or generate? Or is it like, when coming through the port, there's a, there's a fee you have to pay to get rid of

Speaker 1  56:05  
it, you know? I don't know. I don't know about that. All I know is that they got $25 across the meter. So think about if you now bring palm fronds across the meter, right? Or Sagar, so you it's, it's put zillion years in the making, and it's very political scenario, but anyway, but some companies like the pun to kind of companies. They're not using. They're not they're not taking their waste into the into the jungle, right? They're still paying to get rid of ways to do it, right? Okay, so there's a little combo, you know, there's, there are sustainability focused corporations that aren't just gonna drop it, pay someone that's unknown, take it to unknown spot, right so there's little mark. But now, they now, and they're putting the equipment in there, more advanced equipment right now. They're very, you got a lot of Haitian labor, so they're very, very inexpensive labor, I think. And you know now they're, you know, putting machines in and stuff like that, that the purpose will be to make the pellets, not technically a pellet, but the feedstock that will work in our machines. And then we can move it. The central plants of the Hiltons are there, I mean, within a couple miles. So there's, it's not a big movement, but it could be, if they if you had a PPA, it could be in one spot, if you're not selling your thermal. So I would look at bar beta as sort of the hybrid out from an Enexor standpoint, what would excite me would be, we help solve a way. We help monetize. We help solve a waste problem. Monetize, get as much value as we can out of it in the long run. And then the question would be, the gap would be, that's probably going to be seven to 10 megawatts, right? And if you need 25 megawatts to your mass burn biomass, then you know, you need to, you need to dip makeup feed stock, but then we might be competing for the same waste stream. So it wouldn't make sense.

Speaker 2  58:08  
Well, in some sense. I mean, if your system produces electricity without the, you know, on an environmentally sustainable manner, as you, as you said, you know, then we could go to a pure bio math plan, much smaller one, or a smaller one, it would be less cost, because you don't have the expense of the of the waste to energy portion of it, so that, you know, that could still work. I think the utility and Bob, you know, weigh in on this, currently has 25 megawatts put into their, you know, utility expansion plan. And I don't know what time frame they have that in, but it's in the official, you know this is, this is coming on stream at some point. So, you know, we could, we could kind of work around that. And they're very keen to look at base load, because we now have 100 megawatts, roughly, of photovoltaics installed on the island. We have no batteries, so we're getting some fluctuations on the grid. We have, we have some chat challenges there we being the country and and we also in in discussions I had with when the minister called me yesterday, she was very clear that they're looking for ways to generate, you know, very slow, to have less reliance on intermittent so they're that, you know, this kind of technology that we are proposing, that you are proposing, you know, slides right into their their view, they've, They've gone from knowing nothing about energy, you know, 10 years ago, when they first got elected to, you know, being pretty, pretty savvy about, you know, the realities of the energy market and and as you heard the Prime Minister, the Minister, say today, and you potentially heard both of them say yesterday, that cost is is a Big Issue. Because, you know, we are a developing country, even though we enter a pretty high per capita, I think 18,000 US dollars, or something like that, per capita income. Is that right? Something like that, 16, 18,000 you know, there's still a lot of people who need to be lifted, or who would like to be lifted? And yeah, so, so we're there. So what do you think? Bob? Do you have any any responses, or

Speaker 4  1:00:53  
Yeah, or Barry, if I may, if I may, just because it seems that this system works best with clean waste, in other words, with strictly plastics and so on. And you did talk about metals and other ceramics and so on, coming out through the fumes. But I think the big issue here is the municipal waste that all that goat that comes in because we are trying to avoid for future landfills, so that, in my view, is, you know, that's part of it. Yes, they're clean, they're but that all dissipates over time. It's that stuff that just remains in the landfill and all the gasses that come out of the unfilled. But I would say to you, or question you, what is there an opportunity for doing a pilot project with something like this? Because it seems to be a relatively straightforward opportunity. And to be honest, you talk about taxes, I don't think that's going to go down well with government to tax and then give them money back later on. Is how I understood what you were saying.

Speaker 1  1:02:09  
No, I'm not. I'm not promoting, by the way, I'm not. I'm sorry. I'm not promoting that at all. I'm just saying that's what the DR did. Oh yeah, no, I'm not. We're not used to working with government, because we just have too much opportunity. We have too much going on to do that, quite frankly. So I'm not advocating that. I do think to follow up what you're saying. First of all, we can definitely take any combination organic and plastic waste. Doesn't have to be separate. So we can mix. So no matter what, you have to pull stuff out. It's just easier. You know, hotels will do more separation because their customers want it, right? Or industrial weight, weight facility might have, you know, at 10 tons a day of, you know, bogas waste. So it's just by definition, it's more single stream. But anything you do, if you're taking, you know, hyper needles and waste and all that, and you know, you got a big equipment capital to mass burn. I guess if you put the metal, I guess if you burn and all that, if you're doing truly mass burn. But that might be, I guess that's that's sort of a different issue from we're not, we're definitely not chasing that. I mean, we're looking at at recycling or diverting as much as good. So you go back to hotel like, we don't want the stuff out of the bathroom garbage bags. We're getting the stuff that's coming out of the food, the customer ways to not the stuff that we know needs to a landfill.

Speaker 2  1:03:36  
Do get that? I mean, what do we do with the rest of that that can't be done? That's as Bob says, you know, the prime minister says the landfill that's currently operating with a small extension, is the last one on this island. So we need to have a solution for, or as you describe it, the MSW, and most of what comes across our way bridge from the and I can break that that data down a little bit more. But for say, the compactor trucks versus the skips, the skips tend to be cleaner because they come, as you say, from a single source. So even some of those, you know, you go to a construction site, you know, and you know, they'll throw in the plastic buckets and the lunch remains and all that sort of stuff, then someone will throw in four big concrete blocks, right? So it's, it's challenging. We have to separate there have been attempts to to separate streams, and there are some people willing to do that. But it's, it's not, it's not been widely adopted, in part because it hasn't been enforced. But so that's really that this, you know, can we modify your technology to be more reset, not more receptive, but able to deal with with

Speaker 1  1:04:56  
a dirtier stream? Yeah, so I was trying to, trying to download, I can't download the presentation now, but we have, we call it energy conversion hub, our partner that was on the slide. And I know you all haven't heard of you heard of Halbert and all that, but was Ingram industries, and they dominate. They have 90% share of barging all inland riverways. So just think, they just move coal to power plant, everything. So we have the energy. We call it the Eco port, but we have the energy conversion hub. They're building on the river in Nashville, instead of, instead of companies spending going 100 miles for landfill, they go to the hub. And if you were to look at that hub, we have a template. It's like 30,000 square feet. It handles 250 tons a day. This particular hub, it has three lines, and it's it supports enough for 40 of our systems and 10 Bio-CO2 systems and self supporting and cos x dollars, right? And that's what think about what that's what the private equity guys, that's what we're that's the act, that's the deal that's at the table now is replicating that along the river and other places. So to answer your question, what if you if you look at the waste industry, and in general, probably over in the world, but definitely in the United States, whoever controls the waste controls the money of the waste. So if you were to look at a triangle of customers, that top triangle are, what, who we want to go after? They're the sustainability focused companies. They don't want to just send it to cheaper state and, you know, throw it on the side of the road, right? So they, and they also the energy users. So they, but they don't want to separate their ways so that, so they're, they'll still send their ways to this conversion hub, and it's designed for the good stuff we make in the fuel, the next of it, what you can't recycle, goes the landfill. So I would, I would argue that no matter what, you have to have some processing facility that takes those concrete blocks out. No matter what, no matter how people are, there's humans out there. So that's, that would be the extent of it, you know. Then there's the laborious part of it, like they do in Dr, we have people pick it out. Or there's the technology packages now that can do it. So you, so you take your recycling facility, legal. You'd have a line or two for, for an Enexor, and the, you know, if it came in tipping floor, if it's bad stuff, it goes left. This stuff, for energy, goes the right. But just confirm

Speaker 2  1:07:25  
what you mean is by bad stuff, that's just anything that's inorganic. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1  1:07:31  
And I mean, you want to be careful. We don't want people, we don't want we don't want chlorine, but usually it's pretty easy because it's just PVC pipes. But, you know, we can take all types of plastics, you know, from all but I think all the number three, I think whatever the number is, but I can, I show back and show videos and all that stuff. But my point is, I would look at, I know where you're looking at everything as a base load. Power for the utility is where you're sort of coming from. And then I'm looking at is, how do you get as much value and solve a waste problem? And then the question would be, how does that transfer to to a voter, to a customer? That's not just business, right? I mean, that's sort of what we're saying, yeah. And there might, might be a combo of my mind

Speaker 2  1:08:21  
is we have to solve our challenges. We have to solve the whole waste problem, you know, so your your triangle atop makes a lot of sense. That's right, that bottom still got to happen with that, and that has to be

Speaker 1  1:08:34  
paid for, right? It's hard to solve it when you know the price is zero for you, yeah. I mean, that's what I've heard of, exactly.

Speaker 4  1:08:46  
The other thing, well, the value of your system, I would say, Lee, is it really did have water, a need for hot water, because that could be saving and that could also be used for generating other power as well. In China, for example, you had, you know, any other type of system it could be utilized that way, yeah, preheating steam, etc, etc, so that that those are things to look at

Speaker 1  1:09:21  
that's right now, thermal, by the by the way, thermal is really big, because when you're in a natural or you're in a propane or fuel area, you're looking at four or five times the price for thermal. And then especially multinationals, they want, they can buy racks to be green, but they can't buy they can't offset thermal. So looking for green thermal. So I know, I know, again, that's going back to my top triangle. But the key is, or you add a bottoming cycle or something, or secondary cycle, or C or something, which we're involved with some technology that to try to, we don't want to at the long. We don't mind going first. If the energy cost structure is right, we'll strand our thermal, but we're looking at monetizing that thermal in the future, one way or the other.

Speaker 2  1:10:06  
Yeah, yeah. So what do you we're looking at Barry. What are we looking at is a combined cost for for the biomass, and the and

Speaker 6  1:10:27  
the three big working off somewhere around 4 million a megawatt. So I mean, your systems, you're saying that your systems are 225 kilowatts. So what's the sort of the capex site price all in for your 220 version of what you're talking

Speaker 1  1:10:41  
about the Well, I'm not going to provide that information in details, but we would be below the four, 4 million megawatt

Speaker 6  1:10:49  
that's that's fully loaded now, everything to hold in. And that wouldn't,

Speaker 1  1:10:53  
yeah, that wouldn't. That wouldn't include fuel processing. That would be all the energy side. Would not include

Speaker 2  1:11:01  
that, I think, not. Yeah,

Speaker 1  1:11:04  
but remember, we come out for 80 volt grid ready? We actually we have an extra, I think we're gonna have an extra 80, maybe 100 kilowatts of inverter capacity each you that, in other words, you can tie in a solar panel with, you know, all the utility interconnects, the inverters, the PLC is all there to manage it. So it's just the price of these, theoretic, just the price of the panel. So there's other ways to squeeze some, you know, reduce your dollars per kilowatt. That wouldn't be base load, obviously, but there's, there's things we're doing there that are getting could add revenue down line. That's, that's why I mentioned we don't send one anywhere we want to be. We're committed where we can continue to add revenue to our sort of value proposition.

Speaker 4  1:11:51  
Lee, to earn. A question, do you have an opportunity to do if a pilot project? I mean, have you done that like a pilot in those locations that you're in, or have you had to move in? Yeah?

Speaker 1  1:12:04  
Well, first of all, yeah, we're doing one. We have a pilot scheduled in Singapore, the airport airplane. Ways to actually just CO two, and we have a contract with the Navy to deploy one in Hawaii. And we have a contract with the army to play several in military base in Tennessee. And then we have an agreement in the DR in Punta, Cana. Those are the islands type environments. But the thing and we, we and we completely demonstrate everything we have the systems outside our building now. So from our perspective, the power is the same. Anywhere in the world that comes off of it that doesn't change, the thermal is the same. The only thing that changes the input going in, right? So we don't need to, we don't need to send a system to Dominican Republic to prove that it can do pump ramps right so work with the stage we're in right now is now we're priming the pump to get the capital to move to many for Halliburton and Burt Warner to manufacture. So we got a slot starting third second quarter, we get X number of units our power modules that are being built for us a quarter, and it ramps up in 2020 so we're sliding those we have to pay, and we're sliding those for what we are bringing to our existing customers. We're

Speaker 4  1:13:43  
I just have a question to the technology, how do you heat and burn all of the garbage? What? What source are you using to do that? Well, so you have to, like it to break 1000 degrees, see, I think is what you said. Yeah.

Speaker 1  1:13:59  
So what happens? The way, the way we start, when at the start, if it's a cold start, basically, we bring propane, or the propane to the system. We preheat the the combine the reactor vessel to about 650, 700 C, which takes about eight minutes, typically a little longer you want to, you want to make sure you don't cause any temperature damage, of going up too fast or whatever. Then we start dropping the fuel in. And once it gets about 750 is self sustainable, and we take the propane away. It runs. You want to run that, you know, 5000 hours at a time. So it's self sustaining. Once you start

Speaker 4  1:14:40  
it, how many of these you mentioned the different potential locations, how many of them have actually been implemented today and operating, and for how long

Speaker 1  1:14:51  
they're there? We have three, and they're operating just in Tennessee, at our they actually power our building in Tennessee. Okay, in Tennessee, so we probably have, we probably have about 8000 hours collectively. Right now, we run in continuous tests on those. So I would say that with the way to look at our technology would be the, you know, think of it as we have a big step to make, because we've, it's always been, originally been a technical economic play or technical risk play, and now we're past that. Now it's converting to production. That's, that's a big deal, right? Because we now have to go and, like I said, we're, we got a halliburtons involved in Borg Warner takes time. We got it. We're getting certification all that. So that's why we're we're probably nine months out for or for you guys, it'd be in 2027

Unknown Speaker  1:15:50  
your checks. I'm sorry. Okay. Thank you so much.

Speaker 1  1:15:57  
So anyway, I guess that. I guess to come around here to close this out here, do we have a Thursday call?

Unknown Speaker  1:16:05  
Is it well, the prime minister will have a call. The question is, are we on? No, I think, um,

Speaker 2  1:16:17  
I would like to circle back with with my team, my personal opinion is that I think we I think there's enough potential there. Again, our concern to be very upfront, very transparent is the limited operational experience of these plants. I don't know necessarily. Agree with you entirely that you know that, I guess I don't know what I think on this, but that whether or not you need to have something demonstrated here before you can go forward, but I see if we can figure out how to solve the bottom part of the pyramid. You know, I think there this one from a risk point of view, as Bob pointed out earlier, you know, you know, you start small, and then you'll know whether it works before you get to investing $160 million or $100 million or what, whatever. And so there's, there's a certain beauty and a simplicity in that I I grew up with this. Think that, you know, small is beautiful, and you know appropriate technology, and you know, to some extent, sort of, that's what you've developed, with a modern twist, in terms of the guts of it, how you guys have figured out how to make this work and how to clean the gas flu, so that's not polluting, and, you know, recapture carbon. So to me, there's, there's an interest there, but my concern is, concern, me too strong a word. But if there is a concern, it's in it's in the in the longevity of the data, or these things operating. And yes, they work great, but what happens after 15,000 hours to the, you know, the actor, vessel or the ceramic cleaning?

Speaker 1  1:18:19  
I mean, we're not all those things will you know what happens to 40,000 hours? Don't know until you have 40,000 hours on it, right? I think the way I look at it is, remember, we own them. If it doesn't generate a kilowatt hour, our customer doesn't lose a nickel. So we really want to make sure it generates kilowatt hours as we describe. So if we because we're not, we're not here. I'm not having this call to say, hey, you buy x units of ours, and here's our warranty. And you're going to say, Well, sure, I want to make sure. I want to see why Absolutely we're we're understand that we have to manage that risk. What we would do, and this is where I'm not we're sort of doing what you're you know, from a development standpoint, the same thing, we would be focusing on solving that waste problem. How much power can we get at solving the waste problem? That's our fundamental. We're not looking at exporting or importing feedstock anywhere, and that waste is going to continue to grow, would be our premise, and we're going to continue to get value off that by monetizing thermal things like that. And then who do we sell that to? Well, there's no waste value. So in that scenario, let's say there was recycling facility. We'd go, Hey, recycling facility. We'll pay you X dollars a ton for you to give us a next fuel spec. We'll pay you to get this back. Then ideally they're turn they're charging more for a tipping fee, right? That's how they make their money. That's the missing piece. Is that you got, you know, you're solving a waste problem with only power pricing. So everything's off, right? Yeah, nothing's free. To think that, by the way, that's just not only that's even healthy to have a free waste disposal is, you know, it'd be better to charge and give an incentive some other way and have a net zero and then start solving a problem, than to just make always seem like it's free.

Speaker 2  1:20:23  
We agree, and we've argued for them working on this. So you are, you're 100% right, and so I will deputize you.

Speaker 1  1:20:36  
I have now, I'm now, I am now, Captain Obvious. Is my my title?

Speaker 4  1:20:42  
Yeah, yeah. So comment, there just a comment there, Lee, because you, you, I like the idea that you're taking the risk, so you're going to make sure it works. The challenge, I think, from a Barbados perspective, both from a utility as well as waste as the landfill, is that if it doesn't work, there's more than one risk. Yes, you may lose your investment, etc, but we lose the opportunity and may not be prepared for the disposal of waste. And light and power cannot depend necessarily on that unless, and this is where David's point about proven in the environment that we are working in that it actually works. So I'm not saying, you know, negative. I think your idea of managing the risk from your side is important. But there are other aspects in terms of proven technology. And I know Light and Power has particularly, they do not depend on things that are not proven, and it's only when they depend on it that then that's where the value to them will become. So I

Speaker 1  1:21:55  
mean, makes sense. Lee, the big

Speaker 6  1:21:58  
issue here would be that, you know, unless this is proven technology will be un financeable in part latest, we're talking 100 million plus investment here, and it's one of the key concepts, even in talking to some of the multilateral development banks that we've been talking to on funding this, it's got to be proven technology with multiple deployment sites, when I talk in multiple mass deployment sites, globally and things, and that's where the right space is.

Unknown Speaker  1:22:23  
And I'm saying that we would finance it,

Unknown Speaker  1:22:26  
yeah, and you're gonna finance 150 million?

Speaker 1  1:22:29  
No, we wouldn't. We wouldn't put with you. You don't have, you don't have 100 Remember, our our solution is only related to solving the waste problem, and that, that would be the price. So it would be a thing. What we just said is the max would be 10 megawatts, maybe 11 megawatts of just on the power side. So that would be the max we'd be going into. We wouldn't go unless we saw a certain number of minimum we can get that so so we would be financing that. We finance it with, with our with with our partners and with selling carbon credits. And basically, ideally, remember, our customers are AB InBev and the Marriott. So you have, you know where it's a we're able to finance against our energy service agreements with counterparty credit. So the issue here would be, if they're the utility, utility might go, Hey, since you're not all base load power, this is how we would structure our deal, and we don't know how you're going to grow. Here's what we would be paying. Here's the structure that we would be paying for your power, which might be different than base load biomass power. I don't know, but I don't want to spend four years at all, having that negotiated, not at all, I'll lose the last couple of hairs I have in my head.

Speaker 4  1:23:51  
It only took so long, though, because there was a lot of uncertainty in the market about where we were going with PV and with other things. So unlike licenses as well. All of those were in turmoil at that point in time, and most of those issues have been resolved. So I think no PPA should be lasting the length of time, because we were really like the guinea pigs in the process, along with others.

Speaker 1  1:24:21  
So what is the commercial rate? Again, for us, dollars for power by

Unknown Speaker  1:24:27  
because you're still,

Speaker 4  1:24:30  
it's about 20 commercial rate. It's, it's, we talk about it being about 20, between 20 and 24 cents per kilowatt hour.

Speaker 1  1:24:42  
Is that for all? Is that for everything or for just generation?

Speaker 4  1:24:47  
So that is the rate for everything. That's what customers will pay. Okay, but it really stops as well, the value added tax and things so but

Unknown Speaker  1:25:01  
that's actually less time

Speaker 2  1:25:04  
that doesn't that doesn't make sense. Bob, my bill is like 60 cents a kilowatt hour,

Speaker 4  1:25:10  
because, which is what I just mentioned with the value added tax is about 24 cents per kilowatt hour in terms of production. But when you add that depends

Unknown Speaker  1:25:22  
on your cause, adjustments better, right, right? Yeah,

Speaker 4  1:25:25  
exactly. So the fuel clause is about 33 cents, 33 to 36 and the other one is about 20, yeah, probably 20 cents. So it is about 5455 cents per kilowatt hour. But for industrial is cheaper than that. That is a residential customer. So, yeah, so there depends on the value added tax that you add.

Speaker 1  1:25:50  
Okay, so there's a, there's a, we can get busy, there's a full, there's a full rate for power, and then there's a VAT on that, depending on your status, or, yeah, correct, okay, right? Well, I mean, that's, that's the rate then. So if you're behind the meter, you're, you're offsetting both of those Correct,

Unknown Speaker  1:26:09  
exactly, yeah, exactly.

Speaker 1  1:26:11  
So maybe that's the challenge. Yeah, those are that where it

Speaker 4  1:26:15  
makes sense for someone, but government loses money, and then the the somebody has to pick pick up that cost. That is that revenue that is lost somebody has to pay for the infrastructure that light and power would have to pay for. So that is where the challenge comes. But the country benefits, because it solves the waste problem. So you're to your point earlier. You know how? How do we deal with those individual issues?

Speaker 1  1:26:49  
So I think it's safe. I guess my takeaway right now would be, it's if there's going to be that big of a long term diversion between free waste processing and pick up and all that, then I'm not sure if it's good match for us, quite frankly, because it always be a government to sit, you know, now we would have to Go get fuel from you or recycling center, and you're your rates could change all sudden. You can't get the reliable processing of waste. And then, you know, so you got to do your own but you got to have a tipping fee to could just buy the equipment to tread, but there's no tipping fee. So that means got to be power. Then you got to do a PPA with a utility that has different objectives than solving a waste problem.

Unknown Speaker  1:27:47  
So, yeah, those are all things that we, we continue to face and

Speaker 2  1:27:56  
and, you know, we have a solution. I'm not sure. You know, it's the most elegant solution, and that's why I personally am interested in seeing whether or not this technology works, which would then modify slightly Well, what we are doing and how it's funny pants and how it's structured, and reducing the overall risk by simply reducing the overall capital cost, in other words, not not building initially, all that power and bringing it on incrementally, with which you know you can depending on your production schedule. You know, the the and you still have interconnect issues, you know, yeah, you can drop it in and get it ready to work. We still got to plug it into something, whether it's the hotel or the utility grid, so, but those things are relatively quick as compared to building, you know, 25 megawatt biomass plan. So I think that there's an opportunity to look at it in more detail and but, you know, you you guys, have to feel the same way.

Speaker 1  1:29:17  
But he also, I mean, that's a really big penalty too, because if you go behind the meter, you half of the energy prices your VAT. So you save your VAT, which the government doesn't like, because that's the revenue source. So you're already, you're already, you're already lined up against the government any savings, yeah,

Speaker 4  1:29:39  
but I just say that in our model right now, the waste energy part is very much more expensive than the biomass part, and as David said earlier, to make the final price economic, we have to have so much biomass. So maybe with your model we still can do the same thing, have one to offset the other to bring the final price down to a manageable level. So I would not rule out that, meaning, ideally, it would be great that we didn't have to build the biomass plant, but if that is necessary to offset the cost that we are incurring here, and that's why I said earlier. As well, the water park adds value so that offset some of the additional costs, but unless we have a use for it, is just going to be wasted energy.

Speaker 1  1:30:33  
So, so anyway, so Brian's from the government, right out there, right? What do you what's your what's your thoughts?

Speaker 7  1:30:45  
There's still, there's still some other has said in the earlier meeting, the utility should be coming to to be here. But from what I have been, been hearing this seem to be some value along what Stephen was saying in terms of the how do we work the two systems or technologies in such a way where we can reach a point of cost minimalization To satisfy that objective, as well as to see how and as well as to meet the race, you know, the the, How do we address the waste management aspects of it, there will be a trade off, I believe, and given the nuances and in in the in the project, and so how well we manage those nuances Is will impact on the abroad will come what we what we've been discussing thus far in terms of how do we reach that minimization, that cost minimization objective within the context of this management and as David always mentioned, it, looking at it at the Marco economic level in terms of how do we put that cost overall? Because there are those nuances that we are trying to address within the green energy Park framework. So how does your technology help us to achieve those, those objectives. I was thinking that it could, and that the question is, how do we, how do we make that link in an effective way?

Speaker 1  1:33:02  
Okay, real one, this real one quick question, so make sure I'm not missing this. You have the recycling center correct. But then there's a land there's a one landfill on the island, and so there's a there's a tipping fee to that. Is there a tipping feet of that landfill,

Speaker 2  1:33:21  
no, and the government is sanitation service authority runs that we've offered to run it, but it's, it's got its challenges, and most of that is insufficient revenue, because waste is, you know, not as much fun as, you know, a health care center or a nursery school, right? So, so they, they, they really struggle with with revenue. And you know, this is a problem all governments face, you know, maintenance of infrastructure, you know. But Be it water, in the case of the utility of electricity, utility has done a pretty good job of that, but even they will admit that that, you know, in a big hurricane where you know most of our stuffs above ground, you know, we're going to lose power for a while, and so water and waste have been real challenges for all Caribbean governments. I think our government has done a better job of it. But you know, we have this problem we're trying to solve, which is, produce renewable energy, produce it at a cost that is comfortable to the consumer, and solve the waste problem. Whereas, if all we did was, you know, try and produce renewable energy, don't worry about waste. You know, we could do it at that cost. And this is where, you know, the macro economists have to say, Yeah, you're gonna, you're, you know, you're gonna pay a little bit more for this electricity. But here's all the savings you get. So when you add them all up, it's a benefit to the to the country, to the world and to the balance sheet of the government. So it's a tough one. My view is that it's worth exploring and looking at it, putting some of these for some of these plants in and operating with the with the objective that this goes to, you know, a larger, a larger, you know, the project, and then along the way, try and figure out how we solve this solid Waste program. Because, you know, I just The distribution I

Speaker 7  1:37:19  
Hey guys, all the guys there From the meeting, were they able to provide the data he needed

Unknown Speaker  1:37:28  
back on speaking about speaking of power issues, yeah, it's a really

Speaker 2  1:37:41  
interesting market for you, because there is no unified national grid. There's like, three or four separate grids, and then there's all the guys, you know, mining gold and things that just have their own little power systems. So, yeah, I think that's a really interesting opportunity.

Speaker 1  1:37:58  
Well, what I was what I was going to say is that I think what we can do is, you guys, obviously, everyone's at the table. You know, a lot the government's involved. Everyone's there. And so I think the best thing that we could do would be, sort of put our pricing together. What our solution would be for the island member, we're going to go way centric. And then the question would be, how does it fit in to the base load biomass plan? In other words, we could say, hey, all right, we're going to assume we get X dollars a kilowatt and and and, or megawatt, excuse me, and that that, that we will be able to get our waste process, it to, you know, a pellet or whatever, for X dollars, a ton. And if we do that, then here's we can now, now you're going to you're going to have a lot of sustainable going to divert from the landfill, you're going to have carbon emission product, you have all these things. And then you got to figure out, if that price get how does that save anyone any money? Or does it right? That's I think we do that. Then you can see where we would fit in. Yep, that makes sense. Yep, it's today, Tuesday. Let me see if I check the chat. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sagar, I can see if my guys can, we can put a proposal out. We can make some assumptions on that. Do you know if there's tariffs we bring this equipment in for distributed generation or renewables that deserve taxes and fees, or is there anything you know about that

Speaker 2  1:39:37  
there is but, but under this project we, we expect, and have been told that there would be brought in duty free. Okay, so I think you can assume that there's going to be transportation costs, local costs, and just just make a big footnote that this assumes that you know, duty and VAT free importation of this equipment. And then if that turns out not to be the case, then you know that at least you been up front.

Speaker 8  1:40:04  
Okay, yes. You go to our website, energy.gov.bb there is a document referring to

Speaker 7  1:40:15  
renewable energy and introduce energy efficiency fiscal incentives

Speaker 8  1:40:21  
in that. But let, once you download it, there is, I'd say, on the chapter two, where it looks at customs, costs, what is empty, what is not and I do believe bio energy, bio fuel systems are mentioned, to some degree. I think it referenced those systems are exempt from important duty to 20% okay,

Speaker 1  1:40:56  
all right. Well, let me, let me, see me. I'm the Get on. We'll call my guys and see if we can put something together and get it get ready for Thursday, and then you guys can just figure out if it if we're involved, what does it make sense? How does it dovetail what you're doing? Right?

Speaker 7  1:41:15  
Right? Okay, so, so you're going to touch back this with us. Tomorrow is Wednesday.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:26  
You'll be able to talk about this with us by Wednesday.

Speaker 1  1:41:30  
Man, I got I gotta tell you, I'm stacked up. I'm stacked up with meetings and give me Thursday. Thursday is gonna be tough. Let me call my guys right now, and we can, we can put something together, and soon as I put it together, I'll send it out, if you can, if, since my computer's down, if you all know David on your team, or whatever, can you, can you send me email like, who point of contact would be, yes, or whoever might be, whatever names could be more than one. But if you could send that, right,

Speaker 2  1:42:06  
we'll do that, and it will send you will send some just sort of overview of the of the projects that, you know, we produce. They give it, they give an insight to it, you know, overview of what, what we're trying to accomplish, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:42:24  
And I think I'd also like you to think about, you know, you said you you guys, want to own these systems and come in,

Speaker 2  1:42:36  
what, what a partnership might look like. Because that's going to be the first question my chairman and and the CEO of Williams industries is going to ask is, well, you know, why would we? Why would we do this? If it, you know, kills our project effectively, yeah, and the answer, the answer is, it's the better thing to do, and it works, and it solves all the problems, which I don't think it will solve all, but there may be other solutions, opportunity and figure out whether, you know, as Nidhi has said, you keep the green energy Park separate, and you start this, see how it goes, and then there may be some opportunity To merge the two going forward, and you know, or you know, the Prime Minister wants a single, comprehensive solution and figure out how to do that. So I don't really know where she is at this point, other than the wording given by the Minister that she's got the estimates. Which is the for the annual budget, Barbados is on a one April to 31 March fiscal year. I don't know how they ended up with that, but that's where they are. And so she wants to know how much money she's going to have to spend in what timeframe. And I don't know that that Well, I don't know. I don't know what I don't know. So that's, that's sort of where we are now. So I would like to have a conversation, probably with Barry and Dwight and you just to sort of think through what a partnership might look like, just to see, you know, where we come down with on that?

Speaker 1  1:44:24  
Yeah, can just two quick points. One is, I mean, we don't, I have no intention to mess up your deal. So that keep that in mind. That's not if it doesn't make, I'm just saying. But also, second part is that, like we're doing a DR, you know department, you know, every area has its own unique scenarios. So next or Dr, is what we're doing there. We have a partner that has high percentage ownership of it, and it's important they have a 40% tax credit. But to monetize the tax credit, you have to be a DR taxpayer, right? And there's some rules there. So I would be looking at, you know, we would have an Enexor Barbados, which you guys would be a partner of. And so question would be, what's the divvy of it, and who does what? Right? I would, I mean, that would be like any deal, right? So, and then some things, some you know, we could, you know, if we sell, if we sell, you know, 50% of the capex worth of carbon credits. You know, that starts changing how hard it is to finance things, right? Yeah, ideally, if it the carbon credits equal the capex. You can see it's in this, the risk, the decisions to move forward become very simple.

Speaker 2  1:45:35  
So Barry and Bob, there was a long discussion in the first meeting with the minister that that the countries like Switzerland and Singapore are are buying or selling or needing carbon credits, like 100 US dollars a ton. The average price is probably closer to 10 to $30 a ton, but that there is the possibility to pre sell these carbon credits, so that you you sell them, probably, you know, you'll discount them a little bit, and that that brings in the capital to build the plans.

Speaker 1  1:46:07  
And that's what we that's what we'd be asking, that's what we'd be asking the government to do. And we're doing that in Ghana, where they are in Guyana here, and there's Ghana in Guyana. But you know, they have the ability they make a cut on it and and they help sell the credits. And once we get a certain amount, then we deploy systems.

Speaker 2  1:46:29  
Real simple, right? So, as we mentioned in Barbados, as it stands right now, the government gets 100% of carbon credits, which is, which is why people like Williams hasn't really pursued it, to be blunt,

Speaker 1  1:46:42  
yeah, just to just to summarize, the carbon credit market, it generally is set up. That's why, you know, you can't get them for solar and wind. It's set up to facilitate capital financing for new technologies to solve carbon problems. That's the whole purpose. It's not set up to pay a government. It's set up to move do things capital wise, that then offset carbon emissions for a long period of time. So you can't just keep it all right, unless it's a forestry or forest or something. But we're not talking about we're talking about technology based anyway. Let's do this. I think I know what to do. I'll make it. I'm gonna try to grab my guys right now and we'll put a proposal together, as if, with the information I have, we're solving it. We're not trying to solve the 25 megawatt base load problem. And you guys can dovetail and figure out if there's a future modification that makes that happen.

Speaker 2  1:47:41  
Yeah, the only reason that needs to happen is to is to generate the revenue to do all the things the government would like to be done, right? So either that needs to be modified the government's Outlook or or the government's requirements, or, you know, we have to figure out how to generate that and at the same time, make sure that we don't have to build landfills. We know we have to build an ash landfill. And even though some of that can be, you know, as you say, rolled into asphalt or concrete blocks, you know, there's still, there's, you know, we get an incredible range of waste here. We get a lot of toxic chemicals that come out, I mean, not toxic, but just that come out of printing plants. And, you know, slops from from chips coming in we get, you know, oily water. All these things are things that, you know, there's an expectation that can be solved. Whether it's true or not, I don't know there's, there's animal ways, from the arbit, the abattoirs and fish awful and things like that, which there are a lot of very cool technologies out there. But you know, again, it's a question of scale and regular, regularity of. those feed stocks being available. So it's, you know, it's a big puzzle for, particularly for a little small, densely populated island. So, you know, yeah, so that's where we are, okay? So what I will do is, as I said, I'm unfortunately, have to go to California tomorrow for a family event, and so I will try and call you Lee in the morning, or, sorry, it'll be sort of midday tomorrow when I'm in Miami before I fly and we just maybe touch base, or we can do it. We can do it later today, in two or three hours. What are your meetings look like going forward today? When might you have a time slot? Barry's four hours behind us, ahead of us, but Bob and I and Dwight are here.

Speaker 1  1:49:55  
I'm slated. I don't know my schedule tomorrow, because Mark Green has set it all up for me. Okay, he just told me to be ready from nine in the morning on. We're meeting with the president, the prime minister and energy folks and stuff. So I think there's some leeway there, so I can't quite commit, but sort of captive here. Also, if you can't do it, we'll be, I'll be back. I'll be back in Puerto Rico, I think in two or, excuse me, Dominican Republic, in two weeks.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:28  
Yeah, triple the DRS, you have to go through Miami to

Speaker 1  1:50:31  
get Yeah, those those trips, don't also you can,

Unknown Speaker  1:50:36  
er, Panama, yeah. Panama,

Speaker 1  1:50:39  
yeah, okay, well, let's do this. Let's take the net. Let me, let me get let me, my guys are calling me now. Let me, let me, let me put a proposal together with based on all the things we've talked about, or sort of how we look at it. And there might be some x's and y's, but at least look at sort of the structure, and you all can figure out if it makes sense for the government, the individuals and you.

Speaker 2  1:51:00  
All right, all right. Well, I mean, that's going to be Brian and the Minister. I can't speak for them. I can speak for in conjunction with the team here, we can speak for Williams, Caribbean capital and Williams industries, so good. Well. Thank you so much for your time. It's been very, very educational, and we look forward to talking to you, if not, this afternoon, a little bit tomorrow, just to sort of see where we are and figure out what specifically we're going to say to to the prime minister on Thursday, and what time is that meeting? Brian, three 3pm she said.

Speaker 7  1:51:47  
She said, in the Atwood tree. I did not know. Yeah.

Speaker 2  1:51:50  
She said, 3pm she said, 3pm on Thursday. Yeah. Okay, so that'd be 11 O'clock California. time all right? And guys same time frame we are so make seeds. Okay, thanks everyone. And very and very job, okay, yeah, let's, let's talk in maybe about an hour. I've got a couple things I need to do right away. And then, you know, start to put together our strategy and Lee give our numbers and names to your guys in Nashville so they can they can contact us directly if they need additional information. Okay. All right, all right, thank you. Thank you. Take care. You.
